# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for deploying my project is to help other students who are undergoing the same study process as me. I have included all the notes I took during the pre-work study in the bootcamp, and structured them in a way that makes it easier for users to navigate the web application and find what they need.

Building this project has helped me acquire essential skills that will support my progress as a Web Developer, and further my studies in the bootcamp. During the project, I was able to improve my skills in the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, as well as gain a basic understanding of Git, project deployment, and more.
